Abstract
==
The philosopher David Lewis described causation as "something that makes a difference, and the difference it makes must be a difference from what would have happened without it."[^1] This is more or less the interpretation given to causality by most experimentalists. It is a simple definition but it has many implications that can trip you up. Here are ten ideas implied by this notion of causality that matter for research strategies.
