<!-- title: "10 Things to Know About Conducting a Meta-Analysis" -->
<!-- author: 'Methods Guide Author: Don Green' -->

1. What is meta-analysis?
==
Meta-analysis is a method for summarizing the statistical findings from a research literature. For example, if five experiments have been conducted using the same intervention and outcome measure, one might imagine pooling these five studies together into a single dataset and analyzing them jointly, as though the studies came from five blocks within a single experiment. In essence, a meta-analysis renders a weighted average of the five studies’ results. As explained below, this method is also used to summarize research literatures that comprise a diverse array of interventions and outcomes, under the assumption that the interventions are theoretically similar and the outcome measures tap into a shared underlying trait.

2. How does a meta-analysis differ from a literature review?
==
Meta-analysis often characterized as a form of systematic review insofar as it involves a specific set of data collection and analysis procedures. These procedures are spelled out in great detail by the [Campbell Collaboration](https://campbellcollaboration.org/how-to-conduct-meta-analysis-documents) and by the [James Lind Library](http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/essays/3-3-reducing-the-play-of-chance-using-meta-analysis/). Particular attention is paid to gathering both published and unpublished studies (see below). By comparison, most conventional literature reviews cite the most noteworthy theoretical or empirical contributions but rarely attempt to be comprehensive or to summarize the findings quantitatively. Critics of conventional reviews point out the possibility that the most noteworthy or memorable studies present findings that are unrepresentative of the broader research literature and therefore may be a poor guide for policy. On the other hand, critics of meta-analysis point out that the flaws of individual studies are often lost sight of when their estimates are blended together to generate an overarching conclusion. As Uri Simonsohn once quipped, “Meta-analysis is a sausage factory that uses sausages by other factories as inputs.”
